## MVP User Story
I, a brand manager, want to find the most suitable representative candidate, so that I can promote my products better.
## User stories
I, a sociologist, wants to analyze a person's recent emotional state, so that I can complete research more efficiently.
I, a website monitor，wants to monitor the recent performance of an account， so that I can better decide on penalties for this account.
## Introduction
The application I built is an application that can get the tweets of a Twitter account in the past 7 days and analyze the sentiment conveyed by the tweets of this account. The resulting value reflects the emotional state expressed by the account recently. A value greater than zero shows a positive emotion, a value less than zero shows a negative emotion.
## Result

I did an experiment with Kevin Durant's last seven days of tweets, he has only tweeted 2 times in the past 7 days. After the analysis, I got a negative number. This means his recent emotional state has been relatively negative.
